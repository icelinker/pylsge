# pylsge-A python version of Least Squares Geometric Elements(LSGE) library 
Least Squares Geometric Elements (LSGE) library

The Least Squares Geometric Elements (LSGE) library consits of functions to find the least-squares fit of geometric shapes to data, implementing a number of the geometric fitting routines key functions. It is based on a general purpose non-linear least-squares solver that takes as input function-and-gradient routines, and these routines are implementations of the geometric evaluation key functions.

LSGE matlab library was developed by NPL Centre for Mathematics and Scientific Computing
